How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs are heavily weighted in the decision making process for program development. Their needs are typically accomodated as long as they make sense from a business perspective, they are realistic to include within the project budget and timeline, and they are not contradictory to other product requirements. Creation og User stories can help with incorporating user needs into the Product Backlog. Use stories will provide detail on the relative size, prioritization, and technical/design requirments for each user need. User stories can help with Product Backlog management for the Product Owner, and they will serve as a guide for program requirements for the Scrum Master and Development Team. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
